# Wiser Challenge
## Aim
Project for a front-end developer job opportunity at [Wiser Educação](https://wisereducacao.com/). The challenge consisted in a login page that had to be built in React and hosted somewhere. The prototype can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/zC98pMR61WhKX5joTKTMr6/Teste-Wiser?node-id=3%3A4) and the final result was put on air thanks to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and is available [here](https://wiser-challenge-psi.vercel.app/). This doc also contains instructions on how to build and run it.
## Technologies
* <s>TypesScript</s>* JavaScript
* React
* NextJS
* Styled Components
* <s>Redux</s>* React Hooks
* Axios

> *These items have not been used due to time constraints and personal limitations. Unit tests were also not written. TypeScript and Redux are undoubtedly amazing tools and it is a shame I am still not comfortable with either of them -- for now. Also, Redux was set aside due to the simplistic scope and consequently the light state management that the project demanded. Instead, React Hooks were used in order to handle state.
## Requirements
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
## Running the project
